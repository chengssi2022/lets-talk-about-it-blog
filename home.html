		<h1>So glad you're here! </h1>
		<p>It took me so long to finally have a content in this blog. To be honest, I didn’t really have anything to write here when I created this blog. I was just too excited with the title. It’s because I can relate to it. But making a title according to what you are going through in life is so much easier compared to actually writing the content. So I thought, for weeks, about what I really wanted to write here. What do I want to convey? Who do I want to inspire? Or just what I wanted to share. I don’t really know yet, until now. But I decided one thing, I will write what my heart has. I will write my journey with Jesus as I wait for my prayers. I will tell when they are answered with a Yes or a No. I will tell when it is so hard already, and if I can still hold on. Basically, I will tell everything that I am going through and will go through while I am waiting. And if it’s worth it.</p>

	<p>Waiting.. Such a difficult word. No one likes waiting, right? Who does? No one likes to wait long for their meal to be prepared, that is why “instant foods” are in every corner. No one likes to wait long on the road in order to get to their destination that is why almost everyone gets their own cars. No one really likes waiting. The thought of it is horrible itself. Admit it, when you wait, or when you’re told to wait, you feel like something precious is stolen from you. What is it? Time. We value our time so much that we are the only one privileged enough to waste it. The thought of others wasting our time by telling us to wait is just not right.</p>


	<p>Hey! I have a question for you. What if, it’s Jesus telling you to wait? How would you respond? What would you tell Him? Will you tell Him, “Lord, I am really busy right now. Can you please just send me the answer right away? Give this sign or that sign, then I’ll take it as an answer.” Or “Lord, I really need it right now, please give it to me now.” </p>


	<p>Yes, I did those prayers. I ask for signs as answers for my prayer. I tell God that I so needed it so He would give it right away. And all those because I don’t have the heart to wait. As Jesus draws me nearer to Him every day, I am slowly understanding the value and art of waiting.</p>


	<p>Waiting in the bible is a common word for testing faith. From the time God tells Noah to wait 	for the Lord to tell him when it was time to go out of the ark. When God tells Abraham that he will have a son, God had required of him to wait. And even to Abraham’s old age, he had waited. When Jacob flee from His brother Esau and went to his mother’s relatives, God told him to wait for he will surely bless him and bring him back to his homeland. And indeed God did! And one of my favorite stories in the bible, Josephs’ story. He had been through a lot of waiting. And not simply waiting, along with the waiting were the many trials and temptations that he had to face. But as you can recall, all of these characters in the bible did not wait for just a short time. They waited for a very, very, very long time. Others waited for decades, others for centuries.</p>
